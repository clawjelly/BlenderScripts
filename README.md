# Blender Scripts
This is a collection of various little scripts helping me through the day.

## operator_delete_context.py

Mimics my delete functionality from 3DSMax

## custom_mode_setter.py

Mimics my mode setting functionality from 3DSMax

## auto_reload_scripts.py

![auto_reloader](img/auto_reloader.PNG)

Checks all loaded files on a timer and reloads them. No more needing to push the red button and tell it to "reload". You can set one script to be executed after reloading.

Additional function is swapping the script path between relative and absolute path. Very useful when you need to share a script along with a blender file, as people might not use the same source path and as such scripts linked in the blender file won't be found.
